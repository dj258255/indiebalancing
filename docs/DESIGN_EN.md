# PowerBalance - Game Balance Tool for Indie Developers

![PowerBalance Screenshot](images/intro.png)

**Live Demo**: https://indiebalancing.vercel.app/

## Overview

**PowerBalance** is a web-based game balance data management tool for indie game developers.

It provides a sheet system and formulas specialized for game development, beyond what Excel offers.

> Local storage based. Works directly in the browser without a server.

---

## Problem Recognition

### Ideal State (Expected Situation)

When managing balance data (character stats, weapon values, level tables, etc.) during indie game development:
- Game-specific formulas (damage formulas, growth curves) should be easy to apply
- Data should automatically sync between sheets (DPS auto-recalculates when weapon stats change)
- Balance state should be visualizable with charts
- Should be able to export directly to JSON for game engines

### Common Needs in Game Balancing

| Need | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Game Formulas | Want to easily apply formulas like DAMAGE, SCALE, TTK |
| Sheet Linking | Related data should auto-recalculate when character stats change |
| Visualization | Want to quickly check growth curves, stat comparisons in charts |
| JSON Export | Extract data in a format directly usable by game engines |
| Clean UI | Frequently used tools should look good for better productivity |

### Research & Learning

**Where I studied:**
- GDC Vault: Practical balancing methodologies (Zynga's formula-driven approach, Slay the Spire data-driven balancing)
- NDC 2018: Nexon's balance planning process
- Academic materials: Csikszentmihalyi's Flow theory, Faucet/Sink model in game economics
- Game dev blogs: TTK/DPS calculation formulas, RPG growth curve design

**What I learned:**
- Balance data should be managed in a "Set standards → Formalize → Visualize → Verify" cycle
- Common formulas exist across games (damage reduction rate, growth curves, TTK)
- Tools used frequently by designers should look good for better productivity

### Solution

**How I solved it:**

1. **Implemented 70+ game-specific formula functions**
   - `DAMAGE(atk, def)`: Reduction formula `atk * (100 / (100 + def))`
   - `SCALE(base, level, rate, type)`: 4 growth curve types supported
   - `TTK(hp, damage, attackSpeed)`: Accurate kill time calculation
   - `REF("SheetName", "RowName", "ColumnName")`: Auto-reference between sheets

2. **Auto-sync between sheets**
   - All referencing sheets auto-recalculate when one sheet is modified
   - Circular reference detection and warning

3. **Game-specific visualization**
   - Growth curve charts: Linear, Exponential, Logarithmic, Quadratic, S-Curve comparison
   - Radar charts: Character/item stat comparison
   - TTK/DPS calculator: Weapon efficiency analysis

4. **One-click JSON export**
   - Export entire project to JSON with one button
   - Structure directly parseable by game engines

5. **Ready-to-use UI without setup**
   - Clean design requiring no additional customization
   - Dark mode support
   - Onboarding guide for quick learning

### Limitations of This Tool (Explicitly)

- **Not a game engine plugin**: Provides JSON/code data. Import into engine is developer's job
- **Not a collaboration tool**: Currently for individual use. Cloud/team features planned for later
- **Not an auto-balancing AI**: Does not automatically adjust values. Judgment is the developer's responsibility

## Based on Game Balancing Theory

> This tool is designed based on proven game balancing theories and practical methodologies.

### What is Balance?

**"Planning and adjusting so that the rewards and efforts experienced by players feel natural"**

Balance planning is not just adjusting character strength, but designing the overall numbers and acquisition periods in a game.

**Conditions for good balance:**
1. **Creating value in choices**: Dungeon A (10min/300k gold) vs Dungeon B (20min/100k gold + rare item) → Both choices should be meaningful
2. **Providing growth feedback**: Players should clearly recognize their progress

### Flow Theory

Theory proposed by psychologist **Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi** in the 1970s.

![Flow Theory Diagram](images/flow-theory.png)

**Core Principles:**
- Flow occurs when Challenge and Skill are balanced
- Challenge > Skill → Anxiety/Frustration
- Skill > Challenge → Boredom

**Game Application:**
- Difficulty should adjust to match player skill
- **Staircase difficulty curve**: Gradual increase within each section, slight decrease at new section start → Recovery time provided

---

### Balance Planning Process (3 Steps)

Practical methodology presented at Nexon Developer Conference (NDC 2018):

#### Step 1: Set Standards
- **Define ideal state**: "100 days until final equipment acquisition"
- **Clear reasoning** required for each standard
- Verify with simulation and graphs

#### Step 2: Data Entry
- **Automate** quantifiable parts to reduce errors
- Use **double entry** to verify non-automatable data
- Small mistakes (10k gold → 10k diamonds) can lead to emergency maintenance

#### Step 3: Apply Feedback
- Compare results to standards
- Identify deviation causes and modify data
- **Iterate repeatedly**

**Practical Tip:**
> "If user patterns are hard to predict, **conservative balance** is better. Lower drop rates or stronger monsters → Ease later."

### Growth Curve Types

Basics of RPG level/stat design:

| Curve | Formula | Characteristics | Use Case |
|-------|---------|-----------------|----------|
| **Linear** | `base + level × rate` | Consistent growth, predictable | Casual games, simple stats |
| **Exponential** | `base × (rate ^ level)` | Rapid late growth, hardcore feel | MMO experience, upgrade costs |
| **Logarithmic** | `base + rate × log(level)` | Rapid early growth then slows | Reducing level gaps |
| **Quadratic** | `a×level² + b×level + c` | Weak early, accelerates | Skill damage scaling |
| **S-Curve** | `max / (1 + e^(-k×(level-mid)))` | Gentle early/late, rapid mid | Natural growth feeling |

**Design Principles:**
- Experience curve: Exponential (level-up speed gradually slows)
- Character power: Linear or Sub-linear (prevent mudflation)

---

### TTK / DPS Calculation

Core metrics for shooter/action game balancing:

#### DPS (Damage Per Second)
```
DPS = Damage × Shots per second
    = Damage × (Fire Rate / 60)
```

Examples:
- Machine gun: 10 damage × 10 shots/sec = **100 DPS**
- Cannon: 300 damage × 0.33 shots/sec = **100 DPS**

#### TTK (Time To Kill)
```
TTK = (Enemy HP / Damage - 1) × Cooldown
```

**Important:** Last attack doesn't count cooldown (target is already dead)

Example:
- HP 100, Damage 10, 600 RPM (0.1s cooldown)
- Shots needed: 10
- **TTK = 9 × 0.1s = 0.9s** (not 1s!)

**TTK's impact on gameplay:**
- **Low TTK**: First strike advantage, tactical shooters (CS, Valorant)
- **High TTK**: Reaction/evasion important, arena shooters (Overwatch, Apex)

### Economy System: Faucet & Sink

Basic framework for game economy design:

![Faucet & Sink Diagram](images/Faucet-Sink.png)

**Core Principles:**
- **Faucet < Sink**: Prevent inflation, maintain currency value
- **Pinch Point**: Optimal scarcity point where demand is maximized

**Common Sink Designs:**
| Sink Type | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| Consumable purchases | Potions, revival stones, buffs |
| Upgrades | Equipment enhancement, skill level-up |
| Maintenance costs | Repair fees, guild maintenance |
| Gambling/Probability | Enchanting, gacha (negative expected value) |
| Transaction fees | Auction house tax |

### Gacha System Design

#### Pity System

Started with **Granblue Fantasy** in 2016, now industry standard:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Soft Pity** | Probability gradually increases after certain pulls | Genshin 5-star rate increases after 75 pulls |
| **Hard Pity** | 100% guaranteed at specific count | Genshin 5-star guaranteed at 90 pulls |

**Genshin Example:**
- Base 5-star rate: 0.6%
- Up to 74 pulls: Base rate maintained
- 75~89 pulls: Rate spikes (Soft Pity)
- 90 pulls: 100% guaranteed (Hard Pity)

**Design Considerations:**
- Pity too low → Revenue decrease
- Pity too high or none → User churn, regulatory risk
- China: Probability disclosure mandatory, pity systems became standard

### Roguelike Item Synergy

**Slay the Spire** developer's balancing philosophy:

> "It's a single-player roguelike so balancing is easier. Decks don't need to be equal, and we can adjust for **fun** rather than pure balance."

**Core Principles:**
1. **Synergy is discovery fun**: Too explicit becomes a puzzle, too hidden becomes luck
2. **Manage floor curve**: Even runs where nothing works should be playable
3. **Data-driven adjustment**: Quick fixes through player feedback + statistics

**Synergy Example (Slay the Spire):**
- Blade Dance → Shiv cards → Accuracy (Shiv damage+) → Envenom (poison on attack)
- One card connects to multiple build paths

> Source: [Game Developer - How Slay the Spire's devs use data to balance their roguelike deck-builder](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-i-slay-the-spire-i-s-devs-use-data-to-balance-their-roguelike-deck-builder)

## Core Features

### 1. Data Sheets

![Data Sheet](images/data-sheet.png)

- Custom columns (number, text, formula, reference)
- Cross-sheet references (fetch data from other sheets)
- Circular reference detection and error display
- Filter, sort, search

---

### 2. Game Formula Functions

Game development-focused functions instead of Excel functions:

```javascript
// Level scaling (linear, exponential, log, S-curve support)
SCALE(base, level, rate, "exponential")

// Damage calculation (reduction formula)
DAMAGE(atk, def)  // = atk * (100 / (100 + def))

// DPS (with critical)
DPS(damage, attackSpeed, critRate, critDamage)
// = damage * attackSpeed * (1 + critRate * (critDamage - 1))

// TTK (Time To Kill)
TTK(targetHP, damage, attackSpeed)
// = (ceil(targetHP / damage) - 1) / attackSpeed

// Effective HP
EHP(hp, def)
// = hp * (1 + def / 100)

// Drop rate correction
DROP_RATE(base, luck, levelDiff)

// Reference another sheet
REF("Monsters", "Goblin", "HP")
```

**Supported Curves:**
- Linear: `base + level * rate`
- Exponential: `base * (rate ^ level)`
- Logarithmic: `base + rate * log(level)`
- S-Curve: `base + max / (1 + e^(-rate*(level-mid)))`

---

### 3. Sheet Linking

| **Enemies/Monsters** | Enemy stats, AI parameters | Monsters, Spawn Table, Bosses |
| **Drops/Rewards** | Item drops, rewards | Drop Table, Rewards, Chests |
| **Economy** | Currency, shops, prices | Currency, Shop, Faucet/Sink |
| **Gacha** | Probability, pity | Gacha Pool, Rates, Pity |
| **Waves/Stages** | Enemy composition, difficulty | Waves, Stages, Difficulty Curve |
| **Crafting** | Crafting recipes | Recipes, Materials, Craft Time |
| **Affinities** | Element/type matchups | Affinity Table, Elements |

**Combination Examples:**
- Roguelike deck builder: Stats + Skills (cards) + Enemies + Drops
- Tower Defense RPG: Stats + Equipment + Waves + Affinities
- Idle collector: Stats + Gacha + Economy + Equipment

---

- Not a mobile app

---

## Future Possibilities

1. **Community templates**: Share user-created module combinations
2. **AI balance suggestions**: Data-based outlier detection (not auto-balancing, just warnings)
3. **Game engine integration**: Unity/Godot editor extensions for auto JSON import
4. **Version history**: Git-style change history, rollback
5. **A/B testing**: Compare balance versions
6. **Cloud sync**: Account-based storage (when backend added)
7. **Real-time collaboration**: Team project support

---

## FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### Basic Questions

**Q: Can't I just use Google Sheets with Apps Script?**

A: You can. However, considering script writing and maintenance time, it might be better to focus on game development.

**Q: What if my game mixes genres?**

A: There's no genre selection feature. Just pick and combine the feature modules you need.

**Q: Is there a battle simulator?**

A: Monte Carlo simulation is provided. Simulate 1,000~100,000 battles and analyze results with 95% confidence interval (Wilson Score). Supports 1v1, 1vN, NvN team battles and various damage formulas (Simple, MMORPG, Percent, Random).

**Q: Will data be lost if I clear browser cache?**

A: Uses IndexedDB, so regular cache clearing won't delete it. However, clearing all browser data can delete it, so backup is essential.

**Q: Can I export to C# code?**

A: All three engines (Unity, Godot, Unreal) support code export. Unity exports ScriptableObject + JSON, Godot exports Resource + JSON, Unreal exports USTRUCT + CSV.

**Q: Are there paid plans?**

A: Basic features are free. Advanced features like cloud/collaboration may be paid in the future.

**Q: How is this different from machinations.io?**

A: Machinations specializes in economy flow visualization, while this tool specializes in data table management and formulas.

**Q: Can one person build all this?**

A: MVP is sheet + formula + save + export level. Possible by combining existing libraries like TanStack Table, Math.js, Recharts.

**Q: Is there theoretical basis?**

A: Based on Flow theory, Faucet/Sink model, NDC/GDC presentations. Check the references section.

**Q: Why can't I just divide by DPS for TTK?**

A: Because there's no cooldown on the last hit. HP 100, DPS 100 means TTK is 0.9 seconds, not 1 second.

---

### Additional Questions

**Q: If there's no server, can't I use it on other devices?**

A: Adding a server incurs costs and requires monetization. Back up JSON files to cloud drive. Cloud sync feature planned for later.

**Q: Can't I just use Notion or Airtable?**

A: Notion doesn't have game-specific functions like `DAMAGE(atk, def)`. Same for auto sheet linking or growth curve charts. Notion is a general tool, this is specialized for game balance.

**Q: Is this project documentation AI-generated?**

A: Even if referencing summaries, understanding and writing is better than making things by feel. All original links like GDC Vault are attached for direct verification.

**Q: Do indie developers need this much theory?**

A: Theory isn't a universal solution but a checklist. It tells you what to look at when asking "why isn't my game fun?" You don't need to apply everything, just reference as needed.

**Q: If it's MVP with sheet+formula+save, isn't it just Excel?**

A: Excel doesn't have game-specific functions like `SCALE(base, level, rate, "exponential")`. Same for circular reference warnings, Monte Carlo simulation, and game engine code export.

**Q: Will anyone actually use this?**

A: Honestly, I don't know. But "inconvenient but used because familiar" and "no better alternative" are different problems.

**Q: Is it sustainable without a revenue model?**

A: Open source + cloud paid model. All local features are free, only cloud sync/collaboration requiring servers are paid.

**Q: Can't use offline if it's web-based?**

A: PWA supports offline. IndexedDB is local storage so it works without internet. Though not perfect.
